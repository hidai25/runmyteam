Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


My app name is "Run my Team". The targeted users of this app are small running team owners/managers. It has a main aim of facilitating the management of a running team with an app that is built for this purpose. It is designed so that the manager of the team would be able to use it right away with no further programming needs. I designed and built this app so that it answers all the day to day management needs of a team.
First of all the manager will get a superuser and would have to go to the admin part of django. In the admin part he would go to the the table called "SiteAdmin" and will have to fill in the team's basic information (name, number of athletes etc.) so that they appear on the website. Later on, he will go to the coaches table and will fill in his coaches names and will upload a picture of each so that they appear on the websites front page(I put there temporarily pictures of famous athletes). This image upload option is a feature i learned how to do while working on this project. You will see all the necessary things i did for it to work properly in the settings file and you will see a media folder in the coach app to where the pictures are being uploaded.
I limited the number of staff members to 4 in the templating language of django.
After the site is properly initiated with the relevant information it is ready to work.
When a user hits the website he sees the site with the basic information about the team without the navigation bar. He then has to signup. when he signs up he has an option to login as either regular user, premium user or a coach. A regular user is logged in directly after signing up and he gets permission  to see the teams training plan, the announcements and the schedule of the team. It is a free service for him. When a coach signs up he is also logged in right away and he has permission to see the coaches access link where he can write training plans for both each and every premium user and also for the whole team.
I built custom permissions for this purpose as you will see in the code and I used google forms for the coaches access. In the coaches access i facilitated his work by creating some already built in choices so that his work is easier.
When a user signs up as premium user he is directed to a payment form and with the help of a stripe API I implemented, the user can pay a fixed 20 USD one time payment. Then he goes to the login page where he a gets a thank you message and he can login as premium user. This user, as a premium one, has permission to see the private training plan the coach wrote especially to him. he can see the plans of the last 30 days(4 weeks). You will see i wrote the code for it and it works when a premium user is logged in he sees his own plans(if any). The code for the stripe checkout part is mainly taken from stripe documentation.
I handled the case where a user signs up as premium and doesn't pay and later on tries to login with his credentials and then in that case he will get a payment request again.
Every user that is logged in sees as what username he is logged in and what type of membership he has. I made sure also that the super user sees he is logged in as one for control purposes.
Another feature I added is a google calendar where the manager creates a calendar in his own google session. When he makes it public all the users can see what he puts in as data and they can't modify it.
The last feature i added is an announcements part. The manager or the coach goes into the admin part of django and goes in the announcements part and enters the message title and content. He can also limit the amount of time the message remains on the website. For this purpose, I used Pinax announcements which is a proven solution for any site wanting announcements for itâ€™s users. I didn't use all its feature but only what I needed.
I made sure the styling of this website is very modern and have an appealing look. Also, all the pages I created are mobile responsive.
I added all the necessary modules in the requirements.txt file .
I tested all the above mentioned features and they all work.
I Submit this project with the database already filled. If you choose to test the app with an empty database you will have to fill in the groups table with regular, premium and coaches. And also fill in the SiteAdmin table with details so that everything works properly.
In order to test the stripe feature you can use a test credit card number:4242424242424242. Expiry date- any date in the future and any 3 digits ccv code.

If you have any question about the project please do ask.
